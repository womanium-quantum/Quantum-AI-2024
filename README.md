  2. All nationalities, genders, and age groups are welcome to participate in the projects (July 5, 2024 to August 9, 2024). 

### Project Browsing and Selection:
  1. Review all available projects listed below.
  2. Visit each project's repository for a detailed explanation. Each project has unique deliverables and guidelines for successful submission; please read these carefully before selecting a project.

### Team Formation:
  1. Network with fellow participants during the Womanium Team-building events over Zoom and on Discord ("team-formation-for projects" channel) to find your perfect team.
  2. Each project has a unique maximum team size; please read carefully before forming your teams.
  3. Finalize your team and select the project you want to work on by **July 5, 2024**.
  4. Register your team and project on the Canvas Module _"8. Womanium Quantum+AI Projects"_.

### Project Work Period:
  1. Work on your team repository from **July 5, 2024** to **August 9, 2024**.
  2. Fork/duplicate the repository of your selected project. This forked/duplicated repository will be referred to as your _"Team repository"_.
  3. Ensure your repository is public at the time of submission for judging purposes. All work inside your team repository will be considered the final submission for the project.

### Project Submission:

  2. Finalists present 5min. project deck on **Demo Day - August 15, 2024**.
  3. All awards will be announced on Demo Day, August 15, 2024.
  4. Outstanding participants will win QSL Fellowships, starting September 1, 2024.

  
## Womanium QSL Projects:
  ### 1. Quantum+AI for Climate --> *by Naval Nuclear Laboratory*
  [https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Quantum-AI-for-Climate](https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Quantum-AI-for-Climate)
  > (Team Size = max.4)__Participants will apply classical and quantum simulation techniques to model climate and environmental scenarios, bridging theoretical quantum chemistry with real-world applications.
  ### 2. Quantum Machine Learning for Conspicuity Detection in Production --> *by Fraunhofer ITWM*
  [https://github.com/womanium-quantum/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production](https://github.com/womanium-quantum/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production)
  > (Team Size = max.2)__Participants will explore hybrid quantum computing to accelerate data analysis, with training on QML, hybrid models, QNNs -  focusing on optimizing production processes by identifying improvement measures early.
  ### 3. Development of Novel Quantum Algorithms --> *by Classiq*
  [https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Development-of-Novel-Quantum-Algorithms](https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Development-of-Novel-Quantum-Algorithms)
  > (Team Size = max.3)__Participants will delve into quantum algorithms offering exponential advantages, such as Shor’s algorithm, HHL and Hamiltonian simulation, and learn their practical applications through state-of-the-art implementations.
